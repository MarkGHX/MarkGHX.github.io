## About Me

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/). Before joining Purdue, I received both of my M.Eng. degree and B.Eng. degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I was supervised by [Prof. Ruhui Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PcrtqDsAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Tao Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tIjK-3QAAAAJ&hl=en). I also worked with [Prof. Yang Hua](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N0tFi8MAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Hao Wang](https://intellisys.haow.ca/haowang/).

My research interests center around AI Security, especially for the security and fairness issues in Federated Learning and Large Language Models.
